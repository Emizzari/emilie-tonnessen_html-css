# HTML & CSS Course Assignment - Re-Cycle
Re-Cycle was an assignment given to us by the end of the course called "HTML & CSS". The purpose of this assignment was to showcase what we had learned during the last weeks. This was my first website and project ever created.

## Updated Code and Design
At the end of the first year we fine tuned three previous projects. I chose to fix up this one and it is was last updated in June 2020.
